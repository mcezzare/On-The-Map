# On The Map

3º project from the udacity nanodegree course

The On The Map application allows users to share their location and URL with other students.

To view this data, the On The Map application uses a map with location tags and tag annotations for student names and URLs, which allows students to "position themselves on the map".

First, the user logs in to the app using their Udacity username and password or Facebook Account

After login, the app downloads locations and links previously posted by other students. These links can point to any URL that a student shares. After viewing the information posted by other students, a user can post their own location and link. The locations are specified with a string and forward geocoded. They can be as specific as a full street address or as generic as "Brazil, São Paulo Atibaia"

## Running Project

Clone the project

After create folder structure and define which version of Pods you will use in Podfile, is time to running some commands:

- Both the main app and the pods, use the bundler as the version manager of the tools used within the project. We're setting CocoaPods and Fastlane. The settings are in the Gemfile file:

```sh
bundle install
```

Note: If you don't have bundle installed look at [required tools](#required-tools)

- After installing CocoaPods in the version fixed in the project, we can use the `bundle exec` prefix to force the use of CocoaPods in the version described in Gemfile & Gemfile.lock:

```sh
bundle exec pod install
```

- Open project using Workspace generated by CocoaPods:

```sh
open catho.xcworkspace
```

- With Xcode open, the build / debug process follows the pattern.

## Required-tools

To avoid damage your OS version of Ruby you can use [Rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) installed with [HomeBrew](https://brew.sh/)

1 - Install HomeBrew

```sh
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

2 - Install Rbenv

```sh
brew install rbenv
```

3 - Install version 2.5.3 of Ruby

```sh
rbenv install 2.5.3
```

4 - Inside the `OnTheMap` folder

```sh
rbenv local 2.5.3
```

This command will create a file named `.ruby-version` with this content `2.5.3`

Run

```sh
ruby --version
```

If the version listed is not 2.5.3 add the following lines to your .bash_profile our .profile and reload your xterm session

```sh
# Ruby Stuff RBenv
export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$PATH"
eval "$(rbenv init - )"
```

And run again

```sh
rbenv local 2.5.3
ruby --version
```

5 - Now you can install bundler with gem command

```sh
gem install bundler
```
