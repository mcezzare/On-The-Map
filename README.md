# On The Map

3º project from the Udacity nanodegree course.

The OnTheMap application allows Udacity students to share their location and a URL with other students.

To view this data, the OnTheMap application uses a map with pins with tags annotations for student names and URLs, which allows students to "position themselves on the map".

First, the user logs in to the app using their Udacity username and password or Facebook Account.

After login, the app downloads locations and links previously posted by other students. These links can point to any URL that a student shares. After viewing the information posted by other students, a user can post their own location and link. The locations are specified with a string and forward geocoded. They can be as specific as a full street address or as generic as "Brazil, São Paulo Atibaia"

## Running Project

Clone the project

* Note. Dependencies are only used to logging with Facebook. All sections use native functions of Swift 4.

Install dependencies

```sh
pod install
```

Note: If you don't have cocoapods installed look at [required tools](#required-tools)

- After installing CocoaPods in the version fixed in the project you can run the project

```sh
pod install
```

- Open project using Workspace generated by CocoaPods:

```sh
open OnTheMap.xcworkspace
```

- With Xcode open, the build / debug process follows the pattern.

## Required-tools

To avoid damage your OS version of Ruby you can use [Rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) installed with [HomeBrew](https://brew.sh/)

1 - Install HomeBrew

```sh
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

2 - Install Rbenv

```sh
brew install rbenv
```

3 - Install version 2.5.3 of Ruby

```sh
rbenv install 2.5.3
```

4 - Inside the `OnTheMap` folder

```sh
rbenv local 2.5.3
```

This command will create a file named `.ruby-version` with this content `2.5.3`

Run

```sh
ruby --version
```

If the version listed is not 2.5.3 add the following lines to your .bash_profile our .profile and reload your xterm session

```sh
# Ruby Stuff RBenv
export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$PATH"
eval "$(rbenv init - )"
```

And run again

```sh
rbenv local 2.5.3
ruby --version
```

5 - Now you can install cocoapods with gem command

```sh
gem install cocoapods
```

6 - Back to [Running Project](#Running-Project)
